# PETRARCH VALIDATION SUITE VERBS DICTIONARY -->
# VERSION: 2.0 -->
# Last Update: 12 April 2017 -->

# Change 20 Dec 2016
# 1. convert to CAMEO 2.0 format

# Note: This dictionary started out as part of a KEDS dictionary -- hence most of   
# the codes are WEIS, not CAMEO -- and then small parts of it were tweaked quite    
# unsystematically to accommodate various unit tests over the years. Most of the    
# patterns here are not, in fact, actually used in the PETRARCH unit tests, and at  
# some point the whole thing should be edited and substantially reduced in size, as 
# at which point we should also add unique identifiers to the patterns so one can   
# associate specific tests with specific patterns. But at the moment it is mostly   
# just that ad hoc KEDS-based dictionary.  Sorry.                                   

# Change 12 April 2017
# Updated verb codes and added patterns
